One of the advantages of G-SDK is that it can support many programming languages. As of V1.0.0, Java, C#, and Go are supported. Other languages will be supported in the future versions.

| Version | Target Date | Supported Languages |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| V1.0 | Q1 2020 | [Java]({{'/java/' | relative_url}}), [C#]({{'/csharp/' | relative_url}}), [Go]({{'/go/' | relative_url}}) |
| V1.1 | Q2 2020 | C++, node.js, Python |
| V1.2 | Q3 2020 | Android, iOS, Ruby |


The gateway is a gRPC server. So, in theory, you can use any language so long as it is supported by gRPC. However, since there is no language-specific guide, you can only refer to the [API reference]({{'/api/' | relative_url}}) and other [gRPC documentations](https://grpc.io/docs/).
