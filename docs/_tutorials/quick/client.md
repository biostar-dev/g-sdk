One of the advantages of G-SDK is that it can support many programming languages. As of V1.0.0, Java, C#, Python, Node.js, and Go are supported. Other languages will be supported in the future versions.

* [Java]({{ '/java/' | relative_url }})
* [C#]({{ '/csharp/' | relative_url }})
* [Python]({{ '/python/' | relative_url }})
* [Node.js]({{ '/node/' | relative_url }})
* [Go]({{ '/go/' | relative_url }})

The gateway is a gRPC server. So, in theory, you can use any language so long as it is supported by gRPC. However, since there is no language-specific guide, you can only refer to the [API reference]({{'/api/' | relative_url}}) and other [gRPC documentations](https://grpc.io/docs/).
