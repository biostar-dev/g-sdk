* You can connect some BioStar devices to 3rd party ACUs using OSDP protocol. Refer to [the following article](https://support.supremainc.com/en/support/solutions/articles/24000066085) for details. [RS485Config]({{'/api/rs485/' | relative_url}}#RS485Config) is extended to configure the related options.
* New example for user synchronization is added to the client SDKs.

### Bug fixes

* When [XXX_Multi commands]({{'/api/' | relative_url}}#xxx_multi-command) fail, the _deviceErrors_ will not be returned. From V1.4, you can get the detailed information from the error itself. Refer to the user synchronization example of the client SDK.
