### New features

* [Zone APIs]({{'/api/zone/' | relative_url}}) are supported.
  * [APB Zone]({{'/api/zone/apb/' | relative_url}}), [Timed APB Zone]({{'/api/zone/timed' | relative_url}}), [Fire Alarm Zone]({{'/api/zone/fire' | relative_url}}), [Intrusion Alarm Zone]({{'/api/zone/intrusion' | relative_url}}), [Scheduled Lock Zone]({{'/api/zone/lock' | relative_url}}), and [Interlock Zone]({{'/api/zone/interlock' | relative_url}}) are supported.
  * As for V1.2.0, only the local zones are supported. All the devices of a zone should be connected by RS485.
* [Lift API]({{'/api/lift/' | relative_url}}) is supported.
* [Thermal API]({{'/api/thermal/' | relative_url}}) is supported for thermal cameras. 
* [VoIP API]({{'/api/voip/' | relative_url}}) is supported. 
* FaceStaion F2 is supported. To make full use of its multimodal functions, [new authentication modes]({{'/api/auth' | relative_url}}#authentication-mode-for-facestation-f2) are added. 
* You can store the device connection information into the master gateway database. [AddAsyncConnectionDB]({{'/api/connectMaster/' | relative_url}}#addasyncconnectiondb) and [SetAcceptFilterDB]({{'/api/connectMaster/' | relative_url}}#setacceptfilterdb) are added to [the Connect Master API]({{'/api/connectMaster/' | relative_url}}) for this purpose. 
* New examples for [User API]({{'/api/user/' | relative_url}}), [T&A API]({{'/api/tna/' | relative_url}}), and [Thermal API]({{'/api/thermal/' | relative_url}}) are added to the client SDKs.

### Bug fixes

* [User.GetPINHash]({{'/api/user/' | relative_url}}#getpinhash) does not work.
* [Event.EnableMonitoring]({{'/api/event/' | relative_url}}#enablemonitoring) could take a long time when the device has lots of log records. 
* In rare cases, the device gateway might hang when the incoming packets are overlapped. 
* The missing __subCode__ is added to [ImageLog]({{'/api/event/' | relative_url}}#ImageLog), [TNALog]({{'/api/tna/' | relative_url}}#TNALog), and [JobCodeLog]({{'/api/tna/' | relative_url}}#JobCodeLog).
* The __eventID__ in [Event.SubscribeRealtimeLogRequest]({{'/api/event/' | relative_url}}#SubscribeRealtimeLogRequest) and the __mainEventCode__ in [Event.ImageFilter]({{'/api/event/' | relative_url}}#ImageFilter) are changed to the __eventCode__ as in [Event.EventLog]({{'/api/event/' | relative_url}}#EventLog).
* The meanings of __cardSupported__, __fingerSupported__, and __faceSupported__ of [Device.CapabilityInfo]({{'/api/device/' | relative_url}}#CapabilityInfo) are changed. Until V1.1, the value is true if the device can support slave devices with the respective credential. However, since V1.2, the value just indicates whether the device itself supports the credential. For example, __fingerSupported__ is true only if the device has the fingerprint sensor.
