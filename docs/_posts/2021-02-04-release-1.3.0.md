* You can store the slave device information into the master gateway database. [AddSlaveDeviceDB]({{'/api/connectMaster/' | relative_url}}#addslavedevicedb) is added to [the Connect Master API]({{'/api/connectMaster/' | relative_url}}) for this purpose. 
* [Display API]({{'/api/display/' | relative_url}}) is extended to change background images, notice message, and sound files.
* New fields are added to [Event.EventLog]({{'/api/event/' | relative_url}}#EventLog) to provide additional information for specific events.  
* [Extract]({{'/api/face/' | relative_url}}#extract) is added to [Face API]({{'/api/face/' | relative_url}}). You can extract face templates from previously captured image files.

* [Server API]({{'/api/server/' | relative_url}}) is supported for implementing server matching features.
* The short descriptions of event codes are provided as a json file, which can be used in your applications. Refer to the Event API example of your client SDK.
* New examples for [Event API]({{'/api/event/' | relative_url}}), [Door API]({{'/api/door/' | relative_url}}), [Schedule API]({{'/api/schedule/' | relative_url}}), [Trigger & Action API]({{'/api/action/' | relative_url}}), [Wiegand API]({{'/api/wiegand/' | relative_url}}), [Anti Passback Zone API]({{'/api/zone/apb/' | relative_url}}), [Server API]({{'/api/server/' | relative_url}}), and [Status API]({{'/api/status/' | relative_url}}) are added to the client SDKs.

### Bug fixes

* In some cases, [TNA.GetTNALog]({{'/api/tna/' | relative_url}}#gettnalog) returns log records without T&A codes.
* In rare cases, the device gateway might not be able to handle new connections after a connection is not closed properly.
* [User.Enroll]({{'/api/user/' | relative_url}}#enroll) fails when the [UserInfo]({{'/api/user/' | relative_url}}#UserInfo) has face data.
* The name of APB zone package has a typo in Java client library.
