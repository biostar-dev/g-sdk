## Dependencies

The Swift SDK depends on the following libraries.

* [grpc-swift](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift)

## Language mapping

As for mapping messages into swift structures, see the [reference](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf/blob/main/Documentation/API.md).

The generated files, __XXX.grpc.swift__ and __XXX.pb.swift__, will be in _GSDK/Sources_. For their usage, refer to the [tutorials]({{'/swift/' | relative_url}}#tutorials).

## Resources

In addition to the G-SDK API and tutorials, you can also refer to the following documentation. 

* [gRPC Tutorial](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift/blob/main/docs/basic-tutorial.md/)
* [Protobuf Tutorial](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/SwiftProtobuf/1.0.0/)
